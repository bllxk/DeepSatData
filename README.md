# DeepSatData: make datasets of Sentinel images for training machine learning models
![alt text](./diagram.png)
DeepSatData is a toolkit for making datasets from satellite imagery suitable for training machine learning models. 
The process is split into two distinct parts:
- identifying and downloading relevant Sentinel products for an area and time period of interest. Read more in  [download](./download)
- processing downloaded products into datasets. Read more in [dataset](./dataset). 
 
Further details on the methodology used can be found in our papers 
["Context-Self similarity pretraining from crop type segmentation from satellite images"](arxiv url) and 
["Extracting large scale datasets of Sentinel satellite image timeseries for training machine learning models"](arxiv url).
